I'm a computational scientist and electrical engineer specializing in high-performance numerical electromagnetics. I lead a research group at the University of Birmingham, UK, investigating the intersection of computational electromagnetics, numerical methods, and hardware-accelerated computing.

Previously, I worked as a signal and power integrity engineer at NVIDIA, developing electromagnetic simulation methodologies for high-speed interconnect modeling and design. Prior to that, I was a computational scientist at [Flexcompute Inc.](https://www.flexcompute.com/), where I designed and developed hardware-optimized electromagnetic solvers for high-performance simulations in the cloud. For my contributions at Flexcompute, see [here](https://github.com/shashwat-sh).

As part of my doctoral research, I developed fast integral equation / boundary element techniques for the electromagnetic modeling of complex and multiscale systems, such as high-speed electrical interconnects in integrated circuits.
My research was conducted at the [Modelics lab](https://github.com/modelics) in collaboration with AMD, where the solver I developed is currently deployed.
