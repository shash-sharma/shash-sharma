I'm a computational scientist and electrical engineer specializing in the field of computational and applied electromagnetics. I currently work as a signal and power integrity engineer at NVIDIA, developing electromagnetic simulation methodologies for high-speed interconnect modeling and design. In previously worked at [Flexcompute Inc.](https://www.flexcompute.com/), developing on hardware-optimized electromagnetic solvers for high-performance simulations in the cloud.

As part of my doctoral research, I developed fast integral equation / boundary element techniques for the electromagnetic modeling of complex and multiscale systems, such as high-speed electrical interconnects in integrated circuits.
My research was conducted at the [Modelics lab](https://github.com/modelics) in collaboration with [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en), where the solver I developed is currently deployed.
