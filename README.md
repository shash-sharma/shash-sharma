I'm a computational scientist in the field of electromagnetics, currently working at [Flexcompute Inc.](https://www.flexcompute.com/) on high-performance solvers for hardware-optimized electromagnetic modeling on the cloud.

As part of my doctoral research, I developed fast integral equation / boundary element techniques for the electromagnetic modeling of complex and multiscale systems, such as high-speed electrical interconnects in integrated circuits.
My research was conducted at the [Modelics lab](https://github.com/modelics) in collaboration with [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en), where the solver I developed is currently in use.
